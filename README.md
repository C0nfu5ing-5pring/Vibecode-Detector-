# Vibecode Detector™

This is s humorous game that I have made. It is not a full-fledged game, it is a game inside a website (I don't know what to call it).

## Idea behind Vibecode Detector™

This website started with a review from Jane. A project I worked
on was considered vibecoded, and only 17 hours out of 22.7 hours
of the time I spent on it counted. Jane, I did not know that
commits are also considered. Usually I work locally and at last I
commit everything at once and deploy it. I really appreciate and
respect your review I just made this because I needed to complete
some amount of coding hours. Again, this is not a website to
target Jane. Make sure to write "XD" in review of this project so
that I understand you enjoyed it!

TBH, this is just a humorus game, regarding my situation (No worries Jane, I respect your decision) and I built to complete my 6 hours of code.

## Disclaimer

This is just for fun. I am not targetting any single person. If someone feels hurt, I genuienly am sorry! I didn't mean to hurt anybody. Also, Jane if you loved this website just include "XD" in the review so that I understand that I did not hurt your feelings and you enjoyed the website-game, game-website aghhh whatever this is called!

## How it works

- First the user gets a starting screen with a DISCLAIMER.
- User is prompted with their job application like card where they need to enter their name.
- Once the user clicks on save, they get redirected to the home page and click on the play button.
- The user will be given 5 reports (1 at a time) and below the report, two buttons VIBECODED and VALID will be present.
- User needs to decide whether the code is VIBCODED or VALID.
- User can navigate between cards to change their opinion before submitting.
- After clicking on submit, user's score will be visible out of 5.
- After viewing the user's score, the user will be redirected to why this game-website website-game (whatever it is!) was made.
- After that, user can restart the game all over again with different report card.

## Tech Stack

- HTML

- GSAP
- React
- JavaScript

## Development Process

This project was built with regular commits focusing on clarity, structure and UI

## Limitations

- This is not a real evaluation tool. Scores and verdicts are intentionally exaggerated for humor.

## What I learned?

This project helped me learn how reviewers assess work. I had fun builing it and I learnt something real along the way.
