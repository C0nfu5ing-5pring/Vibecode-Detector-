# Vibecode Detector™

This is s humorous game that I have made. It is not a full-fledged game, it is a game inside a website (I don't know what to call it).

## Idea behind Vibecode Detector™

I need you to tell you a story about it. Once upon a time... there was a boy (me) who was participating in a 50 hour coding competition. He had 22.3 hours of code still left to do. He put all the work on that 1 project and completed 22.7 hours of coding session. BUT then enters the plot twist. When the boy was happy and dreaming about completing the challenge, SUDDENLY the reviewer considers his project vibecoded and then considers only 17 hours of code.

TBH, this is just a humorus game, regarding my situation (No worries Jane, I respect your decision) and I built to complete my 6 hours of code.

## Disclaimer

This is just for fun. I am not targetting any single person. If someone feels hurt, I genuienly am sorry! I didn't mean to hurt anybody. Also, Jane if you loved this website just include "HAHAHAHA" in the review so that I understand that I did not hurt your feelings and you enjoyed the website-game, game-website aghhh whatever this is called!

## How it works

- First the user gets a starting screen with a DISCLAIMER
- User is prompted to enter their name
- Once the user clicks on play button a report card come their way with some information
- Now the user has to decide whether it is vibecoded or not
- This will continue for 5 times and everytime the user will get a new report
- After 5 reports, the user will be redirected to another page featuring my message to Jane!
- End, user will again be directed to the disclaimer
