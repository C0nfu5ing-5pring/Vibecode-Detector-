# Vibecode Detector™

This is s humorous game that I have made. It is not a full-fledged game, it is a game inside a website (I don't know what to call it).

## Idea behind Vibecode Detector™

I need you to tell you a story about it. Once upon a time... there was a boy (me) who was participating in a 50 hour coding competition. He had 22.3 hours of code still left to do. He put all the work on that 1 project and completed 22.7 hours of coding session. BUT then enters the plot twist. When the boy was happy and dreaming about completing the challenge, SUDDENLY the reviewer considers his project vibecoded and then considers only 17 hours of code.

TBH, this is just a humorus game, regarding my situation (No worries Jane, I respect your decision) and I built to complete my 6 hours of code.

## Disclaimer

This is just for fun. I am not targetting any single person. If someone feels hurt, I genuienly am sorry! I didn't mean to hurt anybody. Also, Jane if you loved this website just include "HAHAHAHA" in the review so that I understand that I did not hurt your feelings and you enjoyed the website-game, game-website aghhh whatever this is called!

## How it works

- First the user gets a starting screen with a DISCLAIMER.
- User is prompted with their job application like card where they need to enter their name.
- Once the user clicks on save, they get redirected to the home page and click on the play button.
- The user will be given 5 reports (1 at a time) and below the report, two buttons VIBECODED and VALID will be present.
- User needs to decide whether the code is VIBCODED or VALID.
- User can navigate between cards to change their opinion before submitting.
- After clicking on submit, user's score will be visible out of 5.
- After viewing the user's score, the user will be redirected to why this game-website website-game (whatever it is!) was made.
- After that, user can restart the game all over again with different report card.

## What I learned?

This project helped me learn how reviewers assess work. I had fun builing it and I learnt something real along the way.
